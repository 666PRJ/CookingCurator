# COOKING CURATOR

The Cooking Curator application is intended for adults who wish to cook for themselves or others who have dietary restrictions and are unsure of what they can make with their available resources.  Many people can have adverse reactions to foods, ranging from mild to life threatening.  We believe it is important that people can cook food thatâ€™s suitable for themselves, family and friends without having to worry about negative after-effects.  This application will allow users to narrow down their options and can be an easily accessible reference on what to avoid.  It is also possible for food sensitives to change over time and the application would allow an easy way to keep track and plan ahead.
